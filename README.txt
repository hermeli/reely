sudo apt-get install libspnav-dev spnavd

SPNAV: python wrapper for libspnav

To see if your installation is working, spnav comes with a test script
in the module: python -m spnav

Documentation: http://spnav.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html

Main Program is servo.py. I had to copy ssc32.py into local directory
for own modifications of this servo controller class.
